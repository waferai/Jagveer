                <h2>What is Pediatric Neurology?</h2>
                <div class="condition-card">
                    <div class="condition-body">
                        <p>Pediatric Neurology is a specialized branch of pediatric medicine that deals with the diagnosis and treatment of neurological and mental disorders in newborns, infants, young children, and adolescents. Neurological and mental disorders commonly involve conditions affecting the brain, spinal cord, muscles, nerves, and related neural structures.</p>

                        <h4>Who is a Pediatric Neurologist?</h4>
                        <p>A Pediatric Neurologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating brain, spine, nerve, and muscle problems in infants, children, and teenagers. Pediatric neurologists receive specialized training to identify, evaluate, and treat children with neurological and developmental disorders. They typically manage conditions from simple issues such as migraine headaches, febrile seizures, epilepsy to complex problems like cerebral palsy, neurometabolic, neurodegenerative, and genetic disorders.</p>

                        <h4>Difference Between Pediatric Neurologist and Adult Neurologist</h4>
                        <p>Pediatric Neurologists receive special training in both pediatrics and neurology, which helps them understand not just diseases, but also how these conditions affect a child's growth and development over time. In contrast, an Adult Neurologist's training usually focuses on adults and age-related conditions, not on childhood development.</p>
                        <p>In adults, the common causes of neurological issues include trauma, stroke, or lifestyle-related changes. However, in pediatric age group neurology, the causes are more often genetic, metabolic, developmental, or infectious in nature.</p>

                        <h3>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="condition-body">
                        <h4>What is Autism Spectrum Disorder?</h4>
                        <p>Autism spectrum disorder, often called just "autism," is a developmental disability that affects how a person interacts with the world. It often makes it hard for the person to communicate with or understand other people. It can also cause behaviors that are different from how people without autism act.</p>
                        <p>Not everyone with autism thinks and acts the same way. "Spectrum" refers to the wide range of symptoms and behaviors a person might have.</p>

                        <h4>What Causes Autism?</h4>
                        <p>The cause is not fully understood. But it is thought to be related to a person's genes. Sometimes, it can run in families. <strong>There is no evidence vaccines cause autism.</strong> This has been studied very carefully, and no link has been found.</p>

                        <h4>Signs of Autism</h4>
                        <p>The signs of autism include problems in 2 main areas:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Social interaction and communication:</strong> Trouble reading facial expressions, avoiding eye contact, not wanting to be touched, not wanting to play with others, taking longer to learn to speak</li>
                            <li><strong>Limited interests and repetitive behaviors:</strong> Being focused on things that spin or shine, preoccupation with specific topics, having rituals they must follow exactly, repeating physical motions like hand flapping or rocking</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>When Should My Child See a Specialist?</h4>
                        <p>Take your child to a Pediatric Neurologist/Developmental Pediatrician if you notice any of the signs of autism. It's important to do this as soon as possible, so your child can get the help and support they need.</p>

                        <h4>How is Autism Treated?</h4>
                        <p>Treatment depends on the age of the child, what their symptoms are, and whether they have any other medical problems. There is no treatment that can "cure" autism. But therapy can help children communicate and socialize. Having the right support in school can also help them become more independent.</p>

                    <div class="condition-body">
                        <h4>What is ADHD?</h4>
                        <p>ADHD stands for "attention deficit hyperactivity disorder." It is a condition that can make it hard to sit still, pay attention, or make good decisions. ADHD often begins in childhood and can run in families. It is more common in males than in females.</p>

                        <h4>Symptoms of ADHD</h4>
                        <p>Children with ADHD have 1 or more of these:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hyperactivity:</strong> Trouble sitting still or playing quietly</li>
                            <li><strong>Impulsivity:</strong> Interrupting others or doing things without thinking</li>
                            <li><strong>Inattention:</strong> Being forgetful, losing things, trouble finishing projects</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>All these things can cause a child to have trouble in school, at home, or with friends.</p>

                        <h4>How is ADHD Treated?</h4>
                        <p>ADHD can be treated in different ways:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Medicines:</strong> Help children pay attention and concentrate better</li>
                            <li><strong>Behavior treatment:</strong> Therapy to help with ADHD symptoms</li>
                            <li><strong>Changes at school:</strong> Teachers can make accommodations like writing down homework, giving extra time</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>What Can Parents Do?</h4>
                        <ul>

                    <div class="condition-body">
                        <h4>What is Developmental Delay?</h4>
                        <p>Every child grows and learns at their own pace. But when a child is significantly behind in reaching milestones compared to other children of the same age, it may be called a developmental delay.</p>
                        <p>This can affect one or more areas:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Motor skills (sitting, crawling, walking)</li>
                            <li>Speech and language (talking, understanding)</li>
                            <li>Thinking and learning</li>
                            <li>Social and emotional skills</li>
                            <li>Daily activities (feeding, dressing, toileting)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Signs to Watch For</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Not sitting, crawling, or walking at the expected age</li>
                            <li>Not speaking single words by 1.5 to 2 years</li>
                            <li>Poor eye contact or not responding to name</li>
                            <li>Not understanding simple instructions</li>
                            <li>Difficulty playing or interacting with people</li>
                            <li>Repeating certain behaviors</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Treatment and Support</h4>
                        <p>Developmental delay is manageable — early help makes a big difference:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Speech therapy for language and communication</li>
                            <li>Occupational therapy for hand skills and daily activities</li>
                            <li>Physiotherapy for motor delays</li>
                            <li>Special education and behavioral therapy</li>
                            <li>Parental training to support the child at home</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Many children with developmental delays catch up over time, especially if they get the right help early.</strong></p>

                        <h4>Temper Tantrums</h4>
                        <p>Temper tantrums are sudden emotional outbursts — like crying, shouting, kicking, or breath-holding — that commonly occur in children between 1 to 4 years. These are part of normal development.</p>
                        <p><strong>When to seek help:</strong> Tantrums that are violent, very frequent, prolonged (more than 10-15 minutes), or occur beyond 5 years of age.</p>

                        <h4>Nocturnal Enuresis (Bedwetting)</h4>
                        <p>When a child over age 5 unintentionally urinates in bed at night. It is common and usually resolves gradually with age.</p>

                        <h4>What are Seizures and Epilepsy?</h4>
                        <p>Seizures are waves of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They can make you pass out, or move or behave strangely. Most seizures last only a few seconds or minutes.</p>
                        <p>Epilepsy is a condition that causes people to have repeated seizures. Not everyone who has a seizure has epilepsy.</p>

                        <h4>Types of Seizures</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Tonic-clonic (grand mal):</strong> Passing out with muscle stiffness followed by jerking movements</li>
                            <li><strong>Focal seizures:</strong> Shaking in just one arm or part of face</li>
                            <li><strong>Absence seizures:</strong> Suddenly stopping and staring for a few seconds</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>How is Epilepsy Treated?</h4>
                        <p>Epilepsy in children is usually treated with anti-epileptic drugs. These medications do not cure epilepsy but help prevent seizures. If medicines don't work, other options include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Surgery to remove the part of brain causing seizures</li>
                            <li>Neurostimulation (vagus nerve stimulator)</li>
                            <li>Ketogenic diet (high fat, low carbohydrate)</li>

                        <h4>When to Seek Emergency Care</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Seizure lasting more than 5 minutes</li>
                            <li>Repeated seizures without full recovery between them</li>
                            <li>Difficulty breathing during a seizure</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Febrile Seizures</h4>
                        <p>Febrile seizures occur in children ages 6 months to 5 years and are caused by fever. During a febrile seizure, the child usually passes out and has jerking movements. Most last less than 5 minutes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Important:</strong> A febrile seizure does not cause brain damage and does not mean your child will have a life-long seizure condition.</p>

                        <h4>What is Cerebral Palsy?</h4>
                        <p>Cerebral palsy is a disorder that causes problems with movement and balance. It is a permanent condition but does not worsen over time. However, with proper care, its impact can be minimized.</p>
                        <p>Children with cerebral palsy are often delayed in milestones like turning over, sitting, crawling, or walking.</p>

                        <h4>What Causes Cerebral Palsy?</h4>
                        <p>Cerebral palsy results from brain damage occurring before birth, during birth, or in the first two years of life. This damage affects how the brain sends and receives messages.</p>

                        <h4>Associated Conditions</h4>
                        <p>Many children with cerebral palsy may also have:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Difficulty in feeding or drinking</li>
                            <li>Problems with thinking and learning</li>
                            <li>Hearing and speech difficulties</li>
                            <li>Vision problems</li>
                            <li>Seizures</li>
                            <li>Curved spine (scoliosis)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Treatment</h4>
                        <p>Brain damage in cerebral palsy is permanent, so there is no cure. Treatment may include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Medications for stiff muscles or seizures</li>
                            <li>Physical and Occupational Therapy</li>
                            <li>Devices like leg braces, walkers, or wheelchairs</li>
                            <li>Nutritional support</li>
                            <li>Surgery for severe symptoms</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Stem cells have not been proven to cure cerebral palsy by any scientific study so far.</p>

                        <h4>Can Children Get Headaches?</h4>
                        <p>Yes! About 50% of children will have experienced a headache by age 7, and up to 80% by age 15.</p>

                        <h4>Types of Headaches</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Primary Headaches:</strong> The headache itself is the main problem (Migraine, Tension-type)</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h4>Migraine in Children</h4>
                        <p>About 10% of children aged 5-15 years have migraine. Migraine is not just a regular headache:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pain can be on both sides of head (different from adults)</li>
                            <li>Associated with nausea, vomiting</li>
                            <li>Sensitivity to light and sound</li>
                            <li>Visual disturbances</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In younger children, migraine may present as abdominal pain, dizziness, or vomiting without headache.</p>

                        <h4>When to Worry</h4>
                        <p>Consult a pediatric neurologist if your child has:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Headache that wakes them at night</li>
                            <li>Morning headaches with vomiting</li>
                            <li>Sudden, severe "worst ever" headache</li>
                            <li>Headache after a fall or injury</li>
                            <li>Associated fever, neck pain, blurred vision</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Common Triggers</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Excess screen time</li>

                        <h4>What are Movement Disorders?</h4>
                        <p>Movement disorders are neurological conditions stemming from abnormal brain signals, causing involuntary, uncontrolled, or excessive movements — or, in some cases, reduced movement.</p>

                        <h4>Types in Children</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Dystonia:</strong> Sustained muscle contractions causing twisting, repetitive movements or abnormal postures</li>
                            <li><strong>Chorea:</strong> Irregular, flowing, "dance-like" movements affecting limbs and facial expressions</li>
                            <li><strong>Tremor:</strong> Rhythmic shaking, often hands or limbs</li>
                            <li><strong>Tics & Tourette Syndrome:</strong> Sudden, repetitive motor or vocal actions, usually beginning ages 5-10</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Tics in Children</h4>
                        <p>Tics are sudden, repeated, involuntary movements or sounds. They often begin between ages 5 and 10 and usually improve over time.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Motor Tics:</strong> Blinking, head jerks, hopping</li>
                            <li><strong>Vocal Tics:</strong> Sniffing, coughing, repeating words</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Most tics are mild and don't need treatment.</strong> If they cause problems, behavioral therapy (like Habit Reversal Training) can help.</p>

                        <h4>How Can Parents Help?</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stay calm — don't scold or draw attention to movements</li>
                            <li>Reduce stress and ensure good sleep</li>
                            <li>Reassure your child they're not alone</li>
                            <li>Talk to teachers to help them understand</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h4>Symptoms to Watch For</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Delay in motor milestones</li>
                            <li>Frequent falls or difficulty climbing stairs</li>
                            <li>Child uses hands to push up from floor (Gowers' sign)</li>
                            <li>Thin or wasting muscles, or bulky calves</li>
                            <li>Difficulty swallowing in some conditions</li>
                            <li>Breathing problems in severe cases</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)</h4>
                        <p>A genetic condition that weakens muscles over time. It mainly affects boys (about 1 in 3,500). Symptoms often start between ages 2-5.</p>
                        <p><strong>Early signs:</strong> Frequent falls, walking on toes, waddling gait, large-looking calf muscles, using hands to "walk up" legs when standing.</p>

                        <h4>Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)</h4>
                        <p>A genetic muscle disorder where the body does not make enough SMN protein, affecting motor neurons in the spinal cord.</p>
                        <p><strong>Important:</strong> SMA affects only muscles, not the brain. Your child can think, learn, and play like other children. New treatments are available that can change the course of SMA.</p>

                        <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Fever, headache, confusion, trouble speaking, weakness, seizures, stiff neck, sensitivity to light.</p>

                        <h4>Neurocysticercosis (NCC)</h4>
                        <p>An infection of the brain caused by a parasite (pork tapeworm). It occurs when people accidentally eat the eggs of this parasite. NCC is treatable and most children recover well with proper care.</p>
                        <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Wash hands, drink safe water, avoid food from unhygienic sources, deworm regularly.</p>

                        <h4>Childhood Stroke</h4>
                        <p>Yes, children can have strokes. It happens when blood supply to the brain is blocked or there is bleeding. It's rare but serious.</p>
                        <p><strong>Signs:</strong> Sudden weakness on one side, trouble speaking, loss of balance, seizures, severe headache, drowsiness.</p>
